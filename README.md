# Assets with gulp workflow template
Assets template for projects: Folder structure, gulpfile, package.json with dev dependencies.

## What it includes
Set JS and SASS files to watch and, optionally, different ones to compile. I've found this setup to be the most flexible for my various project workflows. The Gulp commands will Browserify JS files, automatically create an SVG icon sprite, compress images, and compile SASS files.

## Watch JS and SASS files and compile them when files change
Gulp task:

  `$ gulp watch`

## SASS files
Gulp task:

  `$ gulp styles`

## Icons 
Gulp task:

  `$ gulp icons`

## Javascript
Gulp task:

  `$ gulp browserify`

##Image compression

Gulp task:

  `$ gulp images`
